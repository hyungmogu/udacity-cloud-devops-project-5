# Setting Up AWS EC2 Plugin

## Introduction

The AWS EC2 plugin for Jenkins allows you to run your Jenkins jobs on a remote server, such as a separate AWS EC2 instance. This not only provides a performance boost by deploying additional instances whenever necessary, but it also enhances the security of your Jenkins jobs. By leveraging the power of AWS, the plugin enables you to efficiently manage your Jenkins builds and scale your infrastructure to meet your needs.
