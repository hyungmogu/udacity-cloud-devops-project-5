# Capstone Project for Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree

This is capstone project for Udacity's Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree. 

## Scope of the project

- Jenkins will be used for CI and CD
- Rolling Deployment will be used
- Cloudformation will be used to build infastructure
- Kubernetes cluster will be built from scratch on AWS
- Kubernetes cluster will be initialized using Ansible and Cloudformation

### Requirements and Resource Estimation

#### Functional Requirements
1. Uploading images from frontend (user) to client
2. Converting image from original format to target format
3. Downloading completed images

#### Non-functional Requirements
1. High-availability: Target availability of 99% and higher.
2. Scalability: The following should not be bottleneck when scales
    1. Uploading images
    2. Simulatenous viewing of website
    3. Downloading images

3. Performance: The conversion should be done as quick as possible, as additional delays will clog the system.

#### Resource Estimation
1. Estimated number of daily active users: 1 million (for demonstration purposes)
2. Max file size per image: 5MB (1280 x 960, png)
3. Max number of files submitted per user: 5
4. Max number of times a user could use this service a day: 5
5. Max size of an image after conversion: 12MB (From 5MB, jpg -> png)

#### Number of servers estimation

- AWS EC2 Pricing information can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)

- Est_number_of_servers_required = Daily_active_users / Server_daily_request_capacity == 1,000,000 / 5,000 = 200 servers

- Given `AWS t4g.medium` costs `$0.0336 server / hour`, it costs
    - `$24.192 server / month`
    - `$4838.40 / month` for 200 servers

#### Bandwidth Usage Estimation (EC2)

- Data transfer in to EC2 is free, so no calculation is required here
- Data transfer out of EC2, we use

```
12MB / file * 5 files * 1,000,000 = 60,000,000 MB  = 60 TB
```

Since AWS charges

1. `$0.09 / GB` for first 10 TB
2. `$0.085 / GB` for next 40 TB
3. `$0.07 / GB` for next 100 TB

The total outbound bandwidth cost is

```
$0.09 / GB * 10,000 GB + $0.085 / GB * 40,000 GB  + $0.07 / GB * 10,000 GB = $5000
```

#### Maximum total costs / month

The maximum total costs would be 

```
$4838.40 / month + $5000 / month = $9838.40 / month
```

Of course, cost can be lowered using cheaper providers like Digital Ocean, but the conclusion here is that a sufficient revenue generating model other than google ad is required to keep this afloat.

## API Design

1. Convert To JPG

```
convertToJPG(image)
```

2. Convert To PNG

```
convertToPNG(image)
```

3. Convert To WEBP

```
convertToWEBP(image)
```

## Project Rubric

### Setup Pipeline

1. Create Github repository with project code.
    - All project code is stored in a GitHub repository and a link to the repository has been provided for reviewers.

2. Use image repository to store Docker images
    - The project uses a centralized image repository to manage images built in the project. After a clean build, images are pushed to the repository.


### Build Docker Container

1. Execute linting step in code pipeline
    - Code is checked against a linter as part of a Continuous Integration step (demonstrated w/ two screenshots)

2. Build a Docker container in a pipeline
    - The project takes a Dockerfile and creates a Docker container in the pipeline.

### Successful Deployment

1. The Docker container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster
    - The cluster is deployed with CloudFormation or Ansible. This should be in the source code of the studentâ€™s submission.

2. Use Blue/Green Deployment or a Rolling Deployment successfully
    - The project performs the correct steps to do a blue/green or rolling deployment into the environment selected. Submit the following screenshots as evidence of the successful completion of chosen deployment methodology:

        - a. Screenshot of the Circle CI or Jenkins pipeline showing all stages passed successfully.
        - b. Screenshot of your AWS EC2 page showing the newly created (for blue/green) or modified (for rolling) instances running as the EKS cluster nodes.
        - c. Screenshot of the kubectl command output showing that the deployment is successful, pods are running, and the service can be accessed via an external IP or port forwarding.
        - d. Screenshot showing that you can access the application after deployment.
